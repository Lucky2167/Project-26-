Recipe to make our food;

 In a medium bowl stir together mayonnaise, 1 teaspoon ground black pepper and lemon juice. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

 Combine the beaten egg and milk in a medium bowl. In a plastic bag combine flour, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and baking powder. Shake to combine.

 Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F. Place the chicken strips into the bag with the flour and shake until the strips are coated. Remove them from the flour mixture and place them onto a plate.Dip them into the egg and milk mixture individually and then place them back into the bag with the flour and shake to coat again. Try and get as much coating as possible on each strip.

 Drop the strips, 3-4 at a time into the hot oil. Stir while frying so that the strips donâ€™t stick together. Fry in the hot oil for 8-14 minutes or until golden brown and fully cooked (the internal temperature has reached 165 degrees F.). Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining strips.

 Heat a large skillet to medium heat. Lay out a tortilla into the skillet and cook until warmed but not crispy. Remove from the pan. Spread a thin layer of the pepper mayonnaise into the center of each tortilla. Add 1-2 of the chicken strips over the mayonnaise. Add lettuce and tomato on top of the chicken. Roll up and serve. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
